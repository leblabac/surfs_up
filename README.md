# Surfs Up Weather Analysis  

## Project Overview  
Reviewing weather patterns in Hawaii to determine the optimal location to open a surf and ice cream shop. After gathering the data, temperatures in June and December were evaluated to determine if the weather conditions could support opening the shop.

## Results

![June](https://github.com/leblabac/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/June_Temps.PNG)   ![December](https://github.com/leblabac/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Dec_Temps.PNG)

Comparing the timeframes:
- Average temperature between June and December show a moderate temperature variance 74.9 (June) and 71.0 (December)
- the maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are remarkably similar
- the minimum temperature of 64 (June) and 56 (December) shows the greatest variance, suggesting that December could be a riskier month to own/operate the surf and ice cream shop, however with the 25th percentile temperature being relatively close to the mean temperature, its possible that "die-hard" surfers will still be around.

## Summary
Overall the summary statistics show that historically, December and June temperatures are very similar, with December having a wider variation, and a low minimum temperature.

For further analysis that may help the decision-making process for the shop, running statistics on the precipitation levels overall, as well as a comparative analysis of the temperatures and precipitation levels for each of the stations, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
